# Problem Statement:
- Create a small Crypto application with live update price.
Upon clicking one of the coins, it'll show detail page consisting candlestick and order book pag.


# How test: 
- Ensure that you have Node js version > 18.0.0 installed.
- Go to project directory, type "npm install" to install dependencies.
- Run npm run dev


# Tech used:
- React / Next js
- TradingView widget


# Things to consider:
- Try to use VPN, as Binance is blocked by government, as some of the data (especially orderbook) is taken from Binance.


# Future improvement:
- Add more features and screens.
- Better coverage at tests.
- Overall UI/UX.
